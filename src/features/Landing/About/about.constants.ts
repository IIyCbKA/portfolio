const ABOUT_FIRST_PARAGRAPH = `My name is Alexander Chernobrovnenko. I'm a web 
developer and software engineer from Belgorod. I'm studying at BSTU named after 
V.G. Shukhov. I'm a music enthusiast and have an immense love for technology.`;

const ABOUT_SECOND_PARAGRAPH = `Currently, I'm working on my own projects, 
dedicating all my free time outside of my studies to them. I believe this is 
essential for my education as a web developer, as technologies are rapidly 
evolving, and it's important to keep up with them.`;

const ABOUT_THIRD_PARAGRAPH = `I began my journey in 2021 when I was a 
10th-grade student and enrolled in the Yandex Lyceum for the "Basics of Python 
Programming" course. The following year, my classmates and I advanced to the 
"Industrial Python Programming" course, where I was introduced to technologies 
such as PyQt, Pygame, and Flask.`;

const ABOUT_FOURTH_PARAGRAPH = `I started focusing specifically on web 
development at the beginning of 2024 and am self-taught. My colleagues and I 
decided to create an analog of the Google Classroom service for our university. 
I had to take on the role of a full-stack developer, although ultimately the 
entire frontend was my responsibility. Since then, I've fallen in love with web 
development, particularly with Node.js, React and Redux, which I used in that 
project.`;

const ABOUT_FIFTH_PARAGRAPH = `Currently, I’m dedicating myself to frontend 
development, and I’m actively transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript to 
leverage static typing for more readable, reliable code, while also expanding 
my expertise on the backend.`;

const ABOUT_SIXTH_PARAGRAPH = `In addition to frontend work, I’ve developed a 
passion for server-side development with Django—building RESTful APIs, managing 
databases, and crafting complete end-to-end applications that complement my 
frontend skills.`;
